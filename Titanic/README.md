# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains my practice work on the Titanic dataset using Python and pandas.

## Key Questions Addressed

### Data Exploration
1. Display Top 5 rows of the dataset.
2. Check the last 3 rows of the dataset.
3. Find the shape of the dataset (rows & columns).
4. Get dataset information (columns, datatypes, memory usage).
5. Get overall statistics of the dataframe.
6. Filter data based on conditions.
7. Check for null values in the dataset.
8. Drop unnecessary columns.
9. Handle missing values.
10. Encode categorical data.

### Univariate Analysis
1. What is Univariate Analysis?
2. How many people survived and how many died?
3. How many passengers were in First, Second, and Third Class?
4. Number of male and female passengers.

### Bivariate Analysis
1. Who has a better chance of survival: Male or Female?
2. Which passenger class has a better chance of survival: First, Second, or Third Class?

### Feature Engineering
- Steps involved in enhancing and preparing data for analysis.
